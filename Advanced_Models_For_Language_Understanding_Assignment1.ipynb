Pass input data through your model to produce predictions (logits).\n        2. Compute the loss w.r.t. the gold label (target).\n        3.

Takes input token IDs `(seq_len, batch_size)` and an initial `hidden` state.\n    2.  Embeds input IDs.\n    3.  Passes embeddings through GRU.\n    4.  Returns all GRU outputs and the final `hidden` state (context vector).\n-   **`init_hidden(batch_size)`**: Creates an initial zero hidden state for the GRU.\n\n### b. `DecoderRNN(nn.Module)`\n\n**Purpose**: To take the Encoder's context vector and generate an output sequence, one token at a time.\n\n-   **Key Layers**:\n    -   `nn.Embedding`: Embeds the current input token for decoding.\n    -   `nn.GRU`: Processes the current token and hidden state.\n    -   `nn.Linear` (`self.out`): Maps GRU output to vocabulary scores (logits).\n-   **`forward(input, hidden)`** (processes one decoding step):\n    1.  Takes the current `input` token ID `(batch_size)` and current `hidden` state.\n    2.  Embeds the `input` token.\n    3.  Passes the embedding and `hidden` state through the GRU.\n    4.  The GRU output is fed to the `nn.Linear` layer to get `output` logits.\n    5.  Returns `output` logits `(batch_size, vocab_size)` and the updated `hidden` state.\n\n### c. `Seq2Seq(nn.Module)`\n\n**Purpose**: Combines the Encoder and Decoder into a single trainable model.\n\n-   **`forward(src, trg)`**:\n    1.  **Encode**: The `src` (input) sequence `(batch_size, seq_len)` is passed through the `self.encoder`. The encoder's final hidden state becomes the decoder's initial hidden state (context).\n    2.  **Decode (with Teacher Forcing)**:\n        -   The decoder starts with an `<SOS>` token as input.\n        -   It iterates for `trg_len` (target sequence length) steps:\n            -   The decoder generates `output` logits and an updated `hidden` state.\n            -   These logits are stored.\n            -   For the next step, the *actual* token from the `trg` sequence is fed as input to the decoder (this is \"Teacher Forcing\").\n    3.  **Return**: A tensor `(batch_size, trg_len, vocab_size)`

This limits performance, especially on long sentences.\n\nWith attention, the decoder **dynamically focuses on different encoder outputs**, depending on what it's trying to generate.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 What You Need to Implement:\nYou will create a new class `Seq2SeqWithAttention`, similar to `Seq2Seq`, but with the following differences:\n\n1. At each decoding step, compute **attention scores** over all encoder hidden states.\n2. Use those scores to compute a **context vector** (weighted sum of encoder outputs).\n3. Feed the context vector into the decoder along with the embedding of the current input token.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Tip: Dot-Product Attention\nA simple form of attention you can implement is dot-product attention:\n\n```python\nscore_t = dot(h_dec_t, h_enc_i) weights = softmax(score_t over i) context_t = sum_i weights[i] * h_enc_i\n```\n\nYou'll apply this at every decoder time step.\n","metadata":{"id":"m9PRjqHkt50Z"}},{"id":"7642e93a-379f-41e0-9da6-a561a25aec65","cell_type":"code","source":"class DecoderRNNWithAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_size, decoder_hidden_size, encoder_hidden_size):\n        super(DecoderRNNWithAttention, self).__init__()\n        self.decoder_hidden_size = decoder_hidden_size\n        self.encoder_hidden_size = encoder_hidden_size # This is the size of the context vector\n\n        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_size)\n\n        # The input to the GRU will be the concatenation of the embedded token\n        # and the context vector from the attention mechanism.\n        self.gru_input_size = embedding_size + encoder_hidden_size\n        self.gru = nn.GRU(self.gru_input_size, decoder_hidden_size, batch_first=False)\n\n        # The output layer maps from the decoder's hidden state to vocabulary size.\n        self.out = nn.Linear(decoder_hidden_size, vocab_size)\n\n    def forward(self, input_token, hidden, context_vector):\n        \"\"\"\n        input_token: (batch_size) -
