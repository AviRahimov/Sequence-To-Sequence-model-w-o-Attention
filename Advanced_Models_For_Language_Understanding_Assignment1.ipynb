        "1. **Prepare your data**:\n",
        "    - Define your dataset by subclassing `torch.utils.data.Dataset`.\n",
        "    - Use a `DataLoader` to iterate efficiently over the dataset in batches.\n",

        "2. **Define your model**:\n",
        "    - Create a model class by subclassing `nn.Module`.\n",
        "    - Define model layers in `__init__`.\n",
        "    - Define how data flows through the layers in the `forward()` method.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Training**:\n",
        "    - Select an appropriate loss function (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, `nn.MSELoss`, etc.).\n",
        "    - Choose an optimizer (`optim.Adam`, `optim.SGD`, etc.).\n",
        "    - **Training Loop** -- For each batch:\n",
        "        1. Pass input data through your model to produce predictions (logits).\n",
        "        2. Compute the loss w.r.t. the gold label (target).\n",
        "        3. Perform backpropagation (`loss.backward()`) to calculate gradients of all model parameters.\n",
        "        4. Update the model parameters with your optimizer (`optimizer.step()`).\n",
        "        5. Reset gradients (`optimizer.zero_grad()`).\n",
