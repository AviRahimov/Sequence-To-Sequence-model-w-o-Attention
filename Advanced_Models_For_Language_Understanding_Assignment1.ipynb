Pass input data through your model to produce predictions (logits).\n        2. Compute the loss w.r.t. the gold label (target).\n        3.

This limits performance, especially on long sentences.\n\nWith attention, the decoder **dynamically focuses on different encoder outputs**, depending on what it's trying to generate.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 What You Need to Implement:\nYou will create a new class `Seq2SeqWithAttention`, similar to `Seq2Seq`, but with the following differences:\n\n1. At each decoding step, compute **attention scores** over all encoder hidden states.\n2. Use those scores to compute a **context vector** (weighted sum of encoder outputs).\n3. Feed the context vector into the decoder along with the embedding of the current input token.\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Tip: Dot-Product Attention\nA simple form of attention you can implement is dot-product attention:\n\n```python\nscore_t = dot(h_dec_t, h_enc_i) weights = softmax(score_t over i) context_t = sum_i weights[i] * h_enc_i\n```\n\nYou'll apply this at every decoder time step.\n","metadata":{"id":"m9PRjqHkt50Z"}},{"id":"7642e93a-379f-41e0-9da6-a561a25aec65","cell_type":"code","source":"class DecoderRNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_size, hidden_size, encoder_hidden_dim, num_layers=2, dropout_p=0.1): # Added encoder_hidden_dim, dropout_p\n        super(DecoderRNN, self).__init__()\n        self.num_layers = num_layers\n        self.hidden_size = hidden_size # Decoder's hidden size\n        self.encoder_hidden_dim = encoder_hidden_dim # Encoder's hidden size *per direction*\n\n        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=vocab_size, embedding_dim=embedding_size)\n        self.embedding_dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout_p) # Added embedding dropout\n\n        # --- Input to LSTM is JUST the embedding ---\n        # The context will be combined *after* the LSTM\n        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=embedding_size, # Input is just embedding\n                            hidden_size=hidden_size,\n                            num_layers=num_layers,\n                            batch_first=True,\n                            dropout=dropout_p if num_layers > 1 else 0) # Add LSTM dropout if multilayer\n\n        # --- CHANGE: Output layer combines LSTM output and RAW context ---\n        # Input features = decoder LSTM hidden size + encoder bidirectional hidden size (enc_hid*2)\n        self.out = nn.Linear(in_features=hidden_size + (encoder_hidden_dim * 2),\n                             out_features=vocab_size)\n\n    def forward(self, input_token, hidden, context):\n        \"\"\"\n        input_token: (batch_size)\n        hidden: tuple (h_prev, c_prev), each (num_layers, batch_size, hidden_size)\n        context: (batch_size, encoder_hidden_dim * 2) -> RAW attention context vector\n        \"\"\"\n        embedding = self.embedding(input_token) # (batch, embedding_size)\n        embedding = self.embedding_dropout(embedding) # Apply dropout\n\n        # Prepare for LSTM: Add sequence length dimension\n        embedding_unsqueezed = embedding.unsqueeze(1) # (batch, 1, embedding_size)\n\n        # Pass embedding and previous decoder hidden state to LSTM\n        lstm_out, hidden = self.lstm(embedding_unsqueezed, hidden)\n        # lstm_out shape: (batch, 1, hidden_size)\n        # hidden tuple shapes: (num_layers, batch, hidden_size)\n\n        lstm_out_squeezed = lstm_out.squeeze(1) # (batch, hidden_size)\n\n        # --- CHANGE: Concatenate LSTM output and RAW context vector ---\n        # lstm_out_squeezed: (batch, hidden_size)\n        # context:           (batch, encoder_hidden_dim * 2)\n        output_concat = torch.cat((lstm_out_squeezed, context), dim=1)\n        # output_concat shape: (batch, hidden_size + encoder_hidden_dim * 2)\n\n        # Apply final linear layer to the combined vector\n        output = self.out(output_concat) # (batch, vocab_size)\n\n        return output, hidden","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-30T23:08:35.558779Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-30T23:08:35.559132Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-30T23:08:35.567270Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-30T23:08:35.559111Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-30T23:08:35.566263Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":12},{"id":"nPvAmc_euarf","cell_type":"code","source":"import math # Needed for sqrt\n\nclass Seq2SeqWithAttention(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, encoder, decoder, sos_idx, device):\n        super(Seq2SeqWithAttention, self).__init__()\n        self.encoder = encoder\n        self.decoder = decoder\n        self.sos_idx = sos_idx\n        self.device = device\n\n        encoder_hidden_dim = self.encoder.hidden_size # Per direction\n        decoder_hidden_dim = self.decoder.hidden_size\n\n        # --- Layers to adapt BiEncoder hidden state to UniDecoder initial hidden state ---\n        self.fc_hidden = nn.Linear(encoder_hidden_dim * 2, decoder_hidden_dim)\n        self.fc_cell = nn.Linear(encoder_hidden_dim * 2, decoder_hidden_dim)\n\n        # --- Layers for Attention Calculation ---\n        # Layer to project encoder outputs (keys) to match decoder hidden dim (query) for scoring\n        self.attn_combine = nn.Linear(encoder_hidden_dim * 2, decoder_hidden_dim)\n        # fc_context IS REMOVED - we return the raw context vector now\n\n        # Optional: Add dropout layer\n        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.1) # Example dropout rate\n\n    def compute_attention(self, decoder_hidden_state, encoder_outputs):\n        \"\"\" Computes attention weights and the raw context vector.
